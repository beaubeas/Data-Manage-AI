I am launching a new SaaS service at https://app.llmonster.ai.

Please generate a standard Privacy Policy text for my new site.
The site uses Google Auth for user login, and we collect the username,
email address, and profile image for the user. But we only use
that information for display in service.

We also allow people to connect their business applications like
Slack and JIRA to our new service, but we don't keep any of the
information from these services. Also, all the information entered
by the user or generated from our service remains owned by the
user - we do not use or sell any of this information.

We do not collect any other information or use or sell any personal
information.
