Please generate an application in python using the FastAPI
package. This application should implement a REST API for
running and managing "agents".

You should implement a set of API routes, and for each route
write the code including the input and output models. These
models should be SQLModel classes and each route should save
or retrieve the models as appropriate. If you have any 
questions please ask first before you generate the code.

The routes needed are:

GET /tools
    Returns a list of string names tools that can be used by an Agent.

GET /models
    Returns a list of string names of the LLM models that agents can use.

POST /runs
    Input payload:
    agent: <the full agent description>, 
    input: <string>, 
    input_mode: <string>, 
    turn_limit:int, 
    timeout: <secs>,
    result_channel: <string>, 
    logs_channel: <string>
    Creates a Run model that includes a run_id and the status, and
    returns the model.

GET /runs/{run_id}
    Returns the Run model for the given run_id.

PATCH /runs/{run_id}
    Input: a Run model
    Updates the properties of an existing Run.

PUT /runs/{run_id}/cancel
    Cancels the indicated Run.
