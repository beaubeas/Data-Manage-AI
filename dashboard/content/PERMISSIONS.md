**Why do we ask for Gmail access?**

LLMonster includes tools for sending and responding to emails. We need your permission
to access your Gmail account do this. But this permission is only used when
you specifically activate the _Gmail_ tool in your agent.

If you don't need email functions you can opt-out from the Gmail scopes during
login and everything will work fine. You can always opt-in later if you want
to build an Email Assistant.
