## Welcome!

Supercog helps you use the power of Large Language Models ("LLMs") to automate
simple or complex tasks at work.

With the power of frontier LLMs under the hood, Supercog integrates with your
common business applications to let you build Assistants which can take autonomous
action on your behalf.

You can automate simple workflows, load data into systems, integrate systems together,
or perform power-user sys admin tasks.

Follow these steps to get started:

**1. Make sure to configure your Open AI API Key in link: [user settings](/settings).**

2. Try browsing some of the Agents from the **Shared** and **Demo** folders. Go ahead
and run one of these Agents, or clone it yourself and use it as a base to get started.

3. Go to **Connections** to connect one of your apps (like Slack, JIRA, Saleforce...) to 
Supercog. When you setup a connection it can be private for your use (like an email
connection) or shared with other people on your team (for shared business apps).
