Write a simple Python library which implements a 
"Credentials service". This library should be class based
and have functions for setting and retrieving credential secrets.

The basic interface should look like:

from credentials import creds_service

creds_servce.set_credential(tenant_id: str, user_id: str, credential_id: str, secret: bytes)
Stores a credential. The tenant_id and credential_id are required but the user_id is optional.

creds_service.get_credential(tenant_id: str, user_id: str, credential_id: str)
 <- returns the plaintext credential

creds_service.delete_credential(tenant_id: str, user_id: str, credential_id: str)
 <- deletes the stored credential

###
Internally the credential service should use a `SQLModel` class to
represent and store each credential in the database.

The credential `secret` should be stored with reversible encryption. 
The credential service should refer to an environment variable called
"CREDENTIALS_MASTER_KEY" to use for seeding the encryption algorithm.
Please use the `Fernet` class from the `cryptography` package for encryption.
